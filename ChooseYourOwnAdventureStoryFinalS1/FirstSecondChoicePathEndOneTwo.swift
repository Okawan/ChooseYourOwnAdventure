When you wake up you are tired, and the only motivation at this point is to finish. You don’t know who might have finished before you, and you want to help fundraise. As you begin your day you are extremely exhausted and can not continue to walk at a fast pace. It takes you about an hour to go a mile. You often take stops and rest. When you get your weekly payment, you are in the middle of nowhere and do not have access to another small town for the next hour or so.\n\nYou eventually get to Anchorage, however, due to slow pace, you have arrive a day late. You do not get the $10,000, but you helped fundraise for the cause. You have come in the very last, and people even began to worry. The following week will be used for recovery, and though the journey was fun, you hurt yourself by not getting rest.\n\nSorry."
