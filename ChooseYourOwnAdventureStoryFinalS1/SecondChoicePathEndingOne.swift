However, du/e to lack of radio communication on weather, it has began to rain, and the rocks on the mountain have become slippery. Some of the trees, ones you do not know whether they are poisonous or weak, or not, are among you, and if you try and grab for the wrong tree, it could be death for you.\n\nYou reach the top after a few days of no rest, and are very exhausted. Unfortunately for you, the rain hasn’t stopped, and you still have to get back down to your base. It will take some resting time on the top of the mountain before you go back down or you could be too tired and exhausted to function, and you might slip. However, you decide to take some pictures of the top view of the mountain before you decide much more. There is no one up by you, and if you try and go down now, the rock on the mountain will still be too wet and slippery. So you decide to not wait, and go down. It was a bad choice. You slip, and die.\n\nSorry!"
