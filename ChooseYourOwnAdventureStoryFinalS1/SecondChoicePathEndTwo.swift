It isn’t wort it to get soaked and risk dying. It was a good choice to stay because had you gone, you would have a chance of getting struck by lightning and slipping.\n\nWhen the rain passes by, you begin to climb, and you take some pictures while up there. It takes you about three days to do all this, and luckily, you have time to relax now. You take your time getting down the mountain, which takes about another 3 days, and then you spend the last week just surviving on the mountain.\n\nYay! You survived!"
