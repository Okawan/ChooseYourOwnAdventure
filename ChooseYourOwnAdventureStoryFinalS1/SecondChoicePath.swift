You have traveled to the Rocky Mountains many time as a younger kid with your parents, and so it is easy to navigate the Rocky Mountains. You’re excited to be able to spend a full three weeks in the Rocky Mountains, despite the danger it holds. You’ll get to camp out in camp sites in the Rocky Mountains, and you’ll also be hiking. It’s a set-up plan, and you think nothing can go wrong. You’re sure nothing can go wrong, you’ve been here many times and know exactly who to do for almost every situation you know of. This will be an easy journey you think. You will be starting in Estes, and be exploring the lakes of the Rocky Mountains. You were lucky to have chosen the Rocky Mountains because you have chosen a laid back journey. However, you will be climbing a mountain. You are expected to be able to live out in the wild for the next three weeks. The government will also be putting a tracker on you so when your third week is over, they will come down and get you.\n\nYou have taken the past week to finish up your first task. So far you have survived, and your first task was to build a tent and a camp ground out of only natural resources. This is where you will be leaving your stuff. However, you know it has been dangerous as by now, you have witnessed close-to-death experience by bears and other wild animals. You have two more weeks to complete the other two tasks. One of which you have no choice: stay alive or die. The other task is to climb to the top of the mountain you are to climb.\n\nChoice1: Climb the mountain now. Choice 2: Wait to climb the mountain until tomorrow."
