You will be starting sometime in the fall and hopefully temperatures will not significantly change, so in the time that you’re there, you will not have any freezing cold nights or extremely hot days.\n\nWhen you get to California, you will be starting in Death Valley and traveling to San Francisco and then to Portland, Oregon. You will be expected to be able to do this in a 3 week time frame (of course). The journey by walking is expected to take around 356 hours (A third of a day roughly, over two weeks). Though that doesn’t include the sleeping time. It could be hot out or cold, and you’ll be in the middle of no where for a bit. You will be getting a lot of stuff, including a good sized tent typically made for two or three people. You will also be getting a compass, and an electronic map (That can go without charging for roughly a week) so as to see where you go. However, the government needs the map back as you are just testing (along with the 15 others if they all so choose to go to Southern California)\n\nOne of the first things you do when you arrive to Death Valley is she yourself, because you don’t want to die from heat stroke. In one day you will be walking roughly 48 miles. Once you have walked 48 miles, you can choose to take a break for a bit, or stay there for the rest of the day or continue walking.\n\nIt begins to get dark out and you have walked about 46 miles. You want to continue going for the next two miles, and then you will have reached a goal. When you finish the two miles you decide to set up your tent with everything inside and call it a day.\n\n The next day you wake up early at 4:00 AM, just barely getting 9 hours of sleep. You can choose to repeat this process or change up as you go along.\n\n Choice 1: Pack up and continue (Repeat the same process as the previous day) or Choice 2: Pack up and continue (None repeated process)"
