You also know that it can get extremely cold and frigid so you’ve asked the government to provide top notch winter gear and camping gear. You’ll be be traveling from Barrow, AK to Anchorage, AK. You're excited to get the adventure started.\n\nWhen you get to Barrow your first thing to do there is to find somewhere to stay, as you'll be arriving late at night. You will be staying at a camp ground, where you will be walking from after you wake up. Because there is many problems with the wild, the first and most simplest task on your trip is to stay alive.\n\nYou have made it through the night, and you will begin your journey through to Anchorage. It takes you about 45 minutes to walk a mile, and your goal by the end of the second week is to get to Fairbanks. On your way to Fairbanks however, you will encounter mountains and extreme temperatures that drop well below 0. As you walk, there will be times, where you will not have a civilization in site, and everything is covered in snow. Everything is going fine so far.\n\n As a little bit over two weeks has passed, and you are almost to Fairbanks. You are extremely tired and exhausted and need sleep. However, getting from Fairbanks, to Anchorage will take another week or so. You can either decide to stay in Fairbanks for a few days, or you can choose to continue to walk. However because of lack of proper sleep, you will be traveling at a slower speed, and will not catch time as efficiently. Choice 1: Stay in Fairbanks for a few days, or Choice 2: Continue going, and only stay a night."
